# Weather-App-Challenge
server-side web APIs challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked to create a weather app using two APIs. One API was used to search for a city's weather, however it needed latitude and longitude coordinates first. Fetching a geolocating API gave us our coordinates, then inputing those coordinates into our second API gave us a five day forecast of any city we typed into the search tab. This challenge was instrumental in understanding the way APIs work and was a great warm up for our first group project.
